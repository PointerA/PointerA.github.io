I am a third year Master’s student in Computer Technology at Sun Yat-sen University, focusing on the acceleration of distributed machine learning systems. My research interests include edge computing, network system, and efficient inference for large language models such as Mixture of Experts (MoE). 

I am truly grateful to be advised by Prof. [Xiaoxi Zhang](https://0xxz.github.io/) during my Master's studies. I was also a Research Assistant at the City University of Hong Kong, where I gained careful guidance from Prof. [Jinhang Zuo](https://jhzuo.github.io/)



<span style="color:red;">New: </span>  **I am actively seeking fully-funded Ph.D. opportunity starting in Fall 2026 or Spring 2027, and am also open to research intern positions.** Please feel free to reach out if you would like to explore potential collaborations or opportunities.

My CV can be found [here](https://pointera.github.io/cv/).
