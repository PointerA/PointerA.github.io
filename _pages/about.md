I am a third year Master’s student in Computer Technology at Sun Yat-sen University, focusing on the acceleration of distributed machine learning systems. My research interests include edge computing, network system, and efficient inference for large-scale models such as Mixture of Experts (MoE). 

I am truly grateful to be advised by Prof. [Xiaoxi Zhang](https://0xxz.github.io/) during my Master's studies. I was also a Research Assistant at the City University of Hong Kong, where I gained careful guidance from Prof. [Jinhang Zuo](https://jhzuo.github.io/).

My CV can be found [here](https://pointera.github.io/cv/).
